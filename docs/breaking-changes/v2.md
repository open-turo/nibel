# Breaking changes in v2

## Description of changes

This release includes a major update to Kotlin version 2.1.20, which introduces breaking changes that may affect existing codebases. The update also includes updates to Dagger and KSP dependencies to maintain compatibility with the new Kotlin version.

### Key Changes

- **Kotlin version upgrade**: Updated from previous version to Kotlin 2.1.20
- **Dagger dependency update**: Updated Dagger to maintain compatibility with Kotlin 2.1.20
- **KSP dependency update**: Updated KSP to maintain compatibility with Kotlin 2.1.20

## Upgrade instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure your project is compatible with Kotlin 2.1.20
- Review any custom KSP processors or annotation processors for compatibility
- Check Dagger-related code for any deprecated APIs or breaking changes

### Required Steps

1. Update your project's Kotlin version to 2.1.20
2. Update Dagger dependencies to the latest compatible version
3. Update KSP dependencies to the latest compatible version
4. Review and update any custom annotation processors if applicable

### Code Examples

If you have custom KSP processors, ensure they implement the latest KSP APIs:

```kotlin
// Update your KSP processor implementations to use the latest APIs
// Check the official KSP documentation for migration guides
```

### Testing

After upgrading:

1. Run your full test suite to identify any breaking changes
2. Test annotation processing and code generation
3. Verify that all Dagger-related functionality works as expected
4. Check that any custom KSP processors continue to function correctly

### Rollback Plan

If you encounter issues, you can temporarily rollback to the previous version while investigating compatibility issues. However, it's recommended to address the breaking changes rather than staying on older versions.
